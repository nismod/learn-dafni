# Learning models and model definitions for DAFNI

[DAFNI](https://dafni.ac.uk/) is the Data & Analytics Facility for National
Infrastructure.

This repository contains toy models and model definitions to test and learn
basic functionality:
- define a container image to wrap a model
- run images locally
- write configuration to run images on DAFNI
- add parameters
- add input datasets
- save outputs

See the [DAFNI docs](https://docs.secure.dafni.rl.ac.uk/docs/how-to/models/how-to-create-a-dafni-ready-model/)
for tutorial and reference documentation.
